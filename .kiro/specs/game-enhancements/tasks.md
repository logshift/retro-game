  - Integrate sparkle effect trigger when obstacle.passed becomes true in updateGame()
  - Create ParticleManager.createConfetti() method to generate confetti particles across screen
  - Configure confetti particles: multiple particles (30-40), distributed x-positions, multiple colors, rotation, gravity
  - Add confetti removal logic for particles below screen (y > canvas.height)
  - Integrate confetti trigger when current score exceeds high score
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 5. Polish and test all features
  - Test score persistence across page reloads and multiple game sessions
  - Verify all particle effects trigger at correct times
  - Test performance with many simultaneous particles
  - Adjust particle counts, sizes, and colors for optimal visual appeal
  - Verify high score display on game over screen
  - Test edge cases: first game (no high score), rapid score increases, extended play
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise
  - _Requirements: All requirements 1.1-5.5_

- [x] 6. Implement dark mode theme system
  - Add theme toggle button to HTML with appropriate styling
  - Create theme state management (isDarkMode boolean)
  - Implement loadDarkModePreference() to load saved theme from localStorage
  - Implement toggleDarkMode() to switch between themes and save preference
  - Implement updateThemeButton() to update button text/icon based on current theme
  - Define color schemes for light and dark modes (sky, ground, grass, pipe, pipeBorder)
  - Create getColors() function to return current color scheme
  - Update drawGround() to use dynamic colors from getColors()
  - Update drawObstacles() to use dynamic colors from getColors()
  - Update draw() function to use dynamic sky color
  - Add CSS transitions for smooth theme changes (0.3s)
  - Add dark-mode class styling for body and canvas
  - Test theme toggle functionality and persistence
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 7. Extend ScoreManager with leaderboard functionality
  - Add leaderboard array property to ScoreManager
  - Implement loadLeaderboard() method to load leaderboard from localStorage using 'flappyTaylorsLeaderboard' key
  - Implement saveLeaderboard() method to save leaderboard array as JSON to localStorage
  - Implement isTopTenScore(score) method to check if score qualifies for top 10
  - Implement addToLeaderboard(score, name) method to insert entry, sort by score descending, and keep top 10 only
  - Add name validation: trim whitespace, default to "Anonymous" if empty, limit to 20 characters
  - Update game initialization to call loadLeaderboard() on start
  - Handle edge cases: corrupted JSON data, invalid entries, empty leaderboard
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 8. Create name entry UI for top 10 scores
  - Add new game state 'enterName' to handle name entry flow
  - Create drawNameEntry() function to render name entry modal overlay
  - Add HTML input element for player name (hidden by default, shown when needed)
  - Style name input modal with semi-transparent background, centered input box, and submit button
  - Update handleInput() to handle name submission when in 'enterName' state
  - Modify game over logic: check if score is top 10, if yes set state to 'enterName', else go to 'gameOver'
  - Add keyboard event listener for Enter key to submit name
  - Add click event listener for submit button
  - Clear input field after submission
  - Transition to 'gameOver' state after name is submitted and added to leaderboard
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.6_

- [x] 9. Display leaderboard on game over screen
  - Create drawLeaderboard() function to render leaderboard table/list
  - Position leaderboard on right side or bottom of game over screen
  - Display rank number (1-10), player name, and score for each entry
  - Style leaderboard with clear headers, aligned columns, and readable font
  - Highlight current player's entry if they just made the leaderboard
  - Handle empty leaderboard gracefully (show "No scores yet" message)
  - Integrate drawLeaderboard() call into drawGameOver() function
  - Ensure leaderboard is visible and doesn't overlap with other game over elements
  - Test with various leaderboard states: empty, partial (< 10 entries), full (10 entries)
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 6.7_

- [ ] 10. Test and polish leaderboard feature
  - Test complete flow: achieve top 10 score → enter name → see leaderboard
  - Verify leaderboard persists across page reloads
  - Test edge cases: empty name (should default to "Anonymous"), very long names (should truncate)
  - Test with multiple players achieving top 10 scores in sequence
  - Verify leaderboard maintains exactly 10 entries maximum
  - Verify scores are sorted correctly (highest to lowest)
  - Test name input validation and sanitization
  - Verify leaderboard displays correctly in both light and dark modes
  - Test with corrupted localStorage data (should handle gracefully)
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise
  - _Requirements: All leaderboard requirements 6.1-6.7_
